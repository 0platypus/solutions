# Manage new employee equipment requests

This solution is a a simple form-based workflow to request equipment from IT
for new employees.

## Description

In this solution, HR submits a request, using Google Forms, for each new
employee requiring system access and equipment. They indicate which
devices the employee will need under various categories. They also include
start dates and office location.

Upon submitting a request, IT is automatically notified to review the request
in Google Sheets. They set up system access and prepare devices and equipment
for the employeeâ€™s first day. Upon completion of the task, they update the
status column in the sheet. With a custom Apps Script, an email
notification is sent to HR once the status is marked as complete.
